# Customer-Churn-Prediction

# Telco Customer Churn Prediction System (AI + Web UI)

This project is a web-based machine learning application that predicts whether a telecom customer is likely to churn (leave the service). It provides business-relevant insights such as churn risk level, service details, and customer profile using a LightGBM model and a Flask-based HTML user interface with captcha verification.

---

## Overview

The system allows users to enter customer information through a web form and receive a real-time churn prediction. It is designed to demonstrate how a machine learning model can be deployed as a web application for practical business use cases such as customer retention and revenue protection.

---

## Features

- Predicts customer churn as YES or NO  
- Displays churn risk level as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH  
- Shows business-related outcomes:
  - Contract type  
  - Monthly charges  
  - Internet service type  
  - Technical support status  
  - Streaming services (TV and Movies)  
  - Customer tenure  
  - Payment method  
- Captcha verification to prevent automated submissions  
- Clean HTML and CSS-based user interface  
- Real-time prediction using a trained LightGBM model  

---

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python, Flask  
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, LightGBM  
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Dataset: Telco Customer Churn CSV dataset

## How to Use

1. Enter the customer details in the web form:
   - Contract type  
   - Monthly charges  
   - Internet service  
   - Technical support  
   - Streaming services  
   - Customer tenure  
   - Payment method  
2. Complete the captcha verification.  
3. Click the "Predict Churn" button.  
4. View the churn prediction and business insights displayed on the page.

## Example Output

Churn Prediction: YES
Risk Level: 0.66 (HIGH)
Contract Type: Two Years
Monthly Charges: 899
Internet Service: DSL
Tech Support: No
Streaming Services: TV = No, Movies = Yes
Customer Tenure: 9 months
Payment Method: Online

## Business Logic

- The churn prediction is generated by a LightGBM classification model trained on historical telecom customer data.  
- The risk level represents the probability of churn:
  - LOW: 0.0 to 0.3  
  - MEDIUM: 0.3 to 0.6  
  - HIGH: 0.6 to 1.0  
- Based on the risk category, the system can be extended to recommend retention actions such as discounts or service upgrades.

## Dataset

This project uses the Telco Customer Churn dataset, a commonly used dataset for machine learning and business analytics related to customer retention in the telecom industry.

---

## Use Cases

- Academic projects and final year submissions  
- Demonstration of machine learning model deployment  
- Business analytics and customer retention strategy simulation  
- Portfolio and resume projects
